# RTXStatus
Discord bot displaying the status of the Revive Tanki X server in real time
# Configuring
To configure, you need to modify `helper/config.json` file.  
First of all, you need to change language.  
"all" - means Russian and English  
"en" - means English  
"ru" - means Russian  
You'll also need to insert you bot's token, which you can acquire on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.con/developers).  
After that, you should open up the console, move to the RTXStatus directory, and write into the console this:
```
npm i && npm start
```
